# Atlassian Allianz Neural Network

In this notebook, I will extend the work from the Atlassian Allianz Data Competition. One of the main criticisms of our solution was that we discussed why we didn't use neural networks but never showed any implementation to compare performance. Additionally, another criticism was that we never showed any experimentation comparing performance on the raw dataset versus iterations of processed data. In an effort to rectify this, I will implement different architectures of neural networks and compare performance on raw and iterated processed data.
